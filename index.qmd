Graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas with a Bachelor’s in International Political Economy, and am finishing an accelerated Master’s degree in Social Data Analytics and Research in May 2026. My work in data and strategy ranges from analyzing the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and federal policies to driving customer engagement strategies in the private sector and advancing operational efficiency in city government.\
\
I excel in translating complex research and analytics into actionable insights that support evidence based decision making. Through these experiences, I’ve built expertise at the intersection of data, policy, and strategy, helping organizations streamline processes, solve problems, and deliver impact. My professional and academic background fuels my passion for strategic decision making and data driven problem solving.
